# Lotide - Joon Lee

A mini clone of the [Lodash](https://lodash.com) library.

## Purpose

**_BEWARE:_ This library was published for learning purposes. It is _not_ intended for use in production-grade software.**

This project was created and published by me as part of my learnings at Lighthouse Labs. 

## Usage

**Install it:**

`npm install @greenlemonkp/lotide`

**Require it:**

`const _ = require('@greenlemonkp/lotide');`

**Call it:**

`const results = _.tail([1, 2, 3]) // => [2, 3]`

## Documentation

The following functions are currently implemented:

* `assertArraysEqual(firstArray, secondArray)`: check if two arrays are equal
* `assertEqual(actual, expected)`: check if two primitive elements are equal or not
* `assertObjectsEqual(actual, expected)`: Returns true if both objects have identical keys with identical values. Otherwise you get back false!
* `countLetters(str)`: Takes in a string and returns a count of each letter in the sentence(string)
* `countOnly(allItems, itemsToCount)`: Takes in a collection of items and return counts for a second parameter of those items
* `eqArrays(firstArray, secondArray)`: Returns true if two arrays compared are equal
* `eqObjects(object1, object2)`: Returns true if two objects compared are equal
* `findKey(names, callback)`: Takes object being calledback and returns first key
* `findKeyByValue(object, value)`: Returns a key on an object where its value matches a given value.
* `flatten(arr)`: It flattens arrays inside array it into a single-level array.
* `head(arr)`: Returns first element in an array
* `letterPositions(sentence)`: Takes an argument and returns object showing position of each letter
* `map(array, callback)`: Returns a new array based on the results of the callback function
* `middle(array)`: Takes in an array and return the middle element(s) of the given array
